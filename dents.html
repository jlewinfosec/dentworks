                <h2>What is PDR?</h2>
                <p>Paintless dent removal is a process that allows us to remove dents, dings, and other body blemishes without the need for paint or body fillers typically used by traditional body shops. This process enables us to restore your vehicle to its original condition at a fraction of conventional body shop repair work or replacement.
                Dentworks can repairs dents that other companies are not capable of repairing, or that they won't even try to repair! From their hand-crafted tools to their friendly customer service, their work is well-received and quality-driven. If you are looking for dent repair, come to the source and perhaps save yourself the markup the dealerships will make if you go to them. Call us to see if you can save money, even if you have filed an insurance claim.
                Our technicians are highly experienced, thoroughly trained, licensed, and insured. Dentworks has the most qualified technicians in the business with the experience, tools, and know-how to do the job right. Paintless dent removal is a metalworking art that requires a great deal of experience, patience, and skill to do correctly. At Dentworks, you'll never have to worry about an inexperienced technician performing any PDR on your vehicle.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>from very small to large dents;</li>
                  <li>the paint has not been broken or cracked;</li>
                  <li>the panel has not had previous body repair.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>NOT all damage to the body of a vehicle can be repaired with PDR techniques, even if a dent cannot be removed completely, we will make the damage almost unnoticeable*.</p>

                <h2>Advantages of PDR:</h2>
                 <ul>
                     <li>no repainting or body filler needed;</li>
                     <li>less expensive than traditional body repair;</li>
                     <li>same-day service in most cases;</li>
                     <li>no risk of paint overspray on other vehicle areas;</li>
                     <li>no risk of incorrect color matching;</li>
                     <li>The vehicle maintains original finish(paint).</li>
                 </ul>
                <p>A vehicle with original paint retains a higher value than a repainted vehicle. Even if it is just a door or a fender, it is always preferable to maintain the original paint on a vehicle for as long as possible. </p>
